### ESP Boards Used in the Project:
In this section, we will delve into the heart of my IoT projects: the ESP boards. These powerful microcontrollers have been instrumental in creating smart and connected solutions.

1. **ESP32**: 
is a versatile and powerful board that offers integrated WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. Its dual-core processor and wide range of peripherals make it an ideal choice for projects requiring high performance and wireless communication.
   - **Technical details**:
     - Processor: Dual-core Xtensa LX6 at 240 MHz
     - Connectivity: WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.2 BR/EDR and BLE
     - Interfaces: GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, PWM, ADC, DAC, etc.
     - Memory: 520 KB SRAM, 4 MB Flash
2. **ESP8266**: 
is another popular and affordable board known for its integrated WiFi connectivity. Although it has fewer resources than the ESP32, it is perfect for simpler projects requiring internet connection and remote control.
   - **Technical details**:
     - Processor: Single-core Xtensa LX106 at 80 MHz
     - Connectivity: WiFi 802.11 b/g/n
     - Interfaces: GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, PWM, ADC
     - Memory: 80 KB RAM, 1 MB Flash
3. **Uses in my Projects**:
Both ESP boards have been used in various projects to control sensors, send data to the cloud, receive remote commands, and automate tasks. Their ease of programming, low power consumption, and active development community make them indispensable tools for implementing IoT solutions.
Throughout this section, I will explore in detail how we have maximized the capabilities of these boards to create intelligent and connected systems that meet the needs of our users.

4. **Boards Used in my Projects**: In this section, I will detail the specific boards that I have used in my IoT projects. Each of these boards has been selected for its particular features and capabilities to meet the requirements of each project.

    - **[WEMOS S2 MINI:](Boards/WEMOS_S2_MINI/README.md)**
      This board uses the **ESP32-S2**, offering an alternative with higher performance and advanced features such as native USB and increased RAM and Flash compared to the ESP8266.

   - **[WEMOS D1 MINI](Boards/WEMOS_D1_MINI/README.md)** v1, v2, v3, and v4:
      These compact boards based on the **ESP8266** are ideal for projects that require WiFi connectivity and a small footprint. Versions v1, v2, v3, and v4 offer progressive improvements in performance and features.

   - **ESP32-DevKitC 38 pins:**
     This ESP32-based development kit offers a wide range of interfaces and peripherals, including GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, PWM, and more, making it a versatile choice for complex projects.

   - **WEMOS D1 UNO R3:**
   The WEMOS D1 UNO R3 combines compatibility with Arduino UNO R3 with the capabilities of ESP8266, making it perfect for projects that need a familiar Arduino interface and WiFi connectivity.

   - **ESP32-C3 Supermini:**
   The ESP32-C3 Supermini is a compact version of the ESP32-C3 that provides WiFi and Bluetooth LE connectivity. Its small size makes it ideal for applications where space is limited.

   - **LOLIN32 Lite:**
   The LOLIN32 Lite is an ESP32-based board that strikes a balance between performance and power consumption. It's ideal for projects requiring WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, as well as processing power.
