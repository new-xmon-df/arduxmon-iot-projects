# LD2410B Human Presence Sensing Module

The LD2410B is a high-sensitivity 24GHz human presence status sensing module developed by Hilink Electronics. It utilizes Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technology to detect human targets within a set space. Combined with radar signal processing and accurate human body sensing algorithms, it achieves high-sensitivity human presence status sensing, capable of identifying human bodies in motion and stationary states. Auxiliary information such as the distance of the target can be calculated. This product is primarily used in indoor environments to sense the presence of moving or micro-moving human bodies and output real-time detection results. The farthest sensing distance can reach 5 meters, with a distance resolution of 0.75m. It provides a visual configuration tool for easily configuring sensing parameters to adapt to specific application needs. The LD2410B supports GPIO and UART output, making it plug-and-play and flexible for various smart scenarios and terminal products.
