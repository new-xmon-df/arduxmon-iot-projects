## Using with ESPHome
The board can be easily integrated with ESPHome for use in Home Assistant. Here are the basic steps to get started:

```yaml
substitutions:
  # I2C
  i2c_address_aht20: "0x38"
  i2c_address_bmp280: "0x77"
  
i2c:
  - sda: GPIO35  
    scl: GPIO33
    scan: false
    frequency: 100kHz

      id: ${esp_id}_aht20_humidity
    address: ${i2c_address_aht20}
    update_interval: never

      id: ${esp_id}_bmp280_pressure
    address: ${i2c_address_bmp280}
    update_interval: never

  - platform: absolute_humidity
    name: "${esp_name} Absolute Humidity"
    temperature: ${esp_id}_aht20_temperature
    humidity: ${esp_id}_aht20_humidity

  - platform: template

    state_class: "measurement"
    unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
    accuracy_decimals: 1
    lambda: |-
      return (id(${esp_id}_aht20_temperature).state + id(${esp_id}_bmp280_temperature).state) / 2.0;
