# Living Room Control System üè†üïπÔ∏è

Welcome to the Living Room Control System project! This project aims to enhance the automation and control capabilities of your living room using various sensors and a Wemos S2 Mini microcontroller (ESP32), integrated with Home Assistant.

## Description
The Living Room Control System focuses on creating a centralized control hub for your living room environment. By utilizing ESPHome for firmware development and integrating with Home Assistant, this project enables you to monitor and control various aspects of your living room, such as lighting, temperature, and more.

## Dependencies
Additionally, the provided `home_assistant_dashboard.yaml` file in this repository is configured using Mushroom cards. Be sure to have Mushroom installed in your Home Assistant to properly render the dashboard layout.

### Mushroom - Dependency for Dashboard Layout
[Mushroom](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/) is a collection of cards for Home Assistant Dashboard UI, serving as a dependency for the dashboard layout in this project. Mushroom's mission is to propose easy-to-use components to build your Home Assistant dashboard.

**Note:** To use Mushroom in your Home Assistant configuration, make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed. Mushroom cards can be easily added to your Lovelace dashboard using HACS.
