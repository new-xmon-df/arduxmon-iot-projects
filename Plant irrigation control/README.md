# Plant Irrigation Control ðŸŒ±ðŸ’§

Welcome to the Plant Irrigation Control project! This project aims to control the soil moisture of multiple plants using various soil moisture sensors, a Wemos S2 Mini (ESP32), a 18650 battery, a TP4046 charger, and an MT3608 voltage booster.

## Description
This project utilizes ESPHome for firmware development and integrates with Home Assistant for dashboard visualization and control. It includes the schematic, PCB design, and Gerber files for easy reproduction and assembly.

## Dependencies

Additionally, the provided `home_assistant_dashboard.yaml` file in this repository is configured using Mushroom cards. Be sure to have Mushroom installed in your Home Assistant to properly render the dashboard layout.

### Mushroom - Dependency for Dashboard Layout
[Mushroom](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/) is a collection of cards for Home Assistant Dashboard UI, serving as a dependency for the dashboard layout in this project. Mushroom's mission is to propose easy-to-use components to build your Home Assistant dashboard.

**Note:** To use Mushroom in your Home Assistant configuration, make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed. Mushroom cards can be easily added to your Lovelace dashboard using HACS.

### ESPHome Configuration (Dependencies)

To enable OTA updates for your ESP devices, make sure to include the following configuration in your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Files where I include various custom configurations for my ESPHome devices.
input_boolean: !include input_boolean_esphome.yaml
```
These lines include necessary configuration for OTA updates in ESPHome, allowing for seamless firmware updates of your ESP devices. Make sure to add them appropriately to your configuration.yaml file.
